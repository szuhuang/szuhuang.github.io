        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA,</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT,</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM,</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            <blockquote>
                Passing cars,
                <br>When you can't see,
                <br>May get you,
                <br>A glimpse,
                <br>Of eternity.
                <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
            <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
            <img src="images/segway1.jpg" width="480" alt="sagway1">
            <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
                <ul>
                    <li>cellphone</li>
                    <li>iPod</li>
                    <li>digital camera</li>
                    <li>and a protein bar</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</P>
